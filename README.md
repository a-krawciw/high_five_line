# high_five_line

This repository holds the code for the Virtual High Five Line™, written for FIRST® Robotics BC's virtual award ceremony. The app allows teams to give each other high fives and celebrate when teams receive awards!

It was written using Quart for the Python back-end. Ask [@a-krawciw](https://github.com/a-krawciw) or [@guystoppi](https://github.com/guystoppi) if you have any questions.

The app is hosted on Heroku, linked [here](http://high-five-line.herokuapp.com/).

Congrats to all the teams at the 2021 FTC British Columbia Championships
